## ‚¨áÔ∏è 2.1.0-beta Changelog

## üöÄ Key Changes
- Complete Codebase Restructure:
We‚Äôve restructured the entire codebase from a single large file into modular components. This not only improves performance but also makes future development and maintenance significantly easier.

- Migration to TypeScript:
ReplayCraft is now written in TypeScript, enabling better tooling, type safety, and reliability across the project.

- Open Source under GPL-3.0:
ReplayCraft is now open source! The project is licensed under the GPL-3.0, allowing the community to contribute and extend the project freely.

## ‚ú® New Features
- Big Build Mode:
ReplayCraft can now record and replay structures that exceed the currently loaded chunk area. This is perfect for large-scale builds that span far beyond your visible range.

- Persistent Storage:
Replays are now saved in a database, enabling players to pause and resume replay sessions across multiple game sessions.

- Multi-Session Support:
Players can now manage multiple replays. When creating a new session, you‚Äôll be prompted to name it. Later, you can browse and select any saved session to resume or playback.

- HUD Toggle Setting:
A new setting allows you to toggle HUD elements on or off during replay playback, giving more control over your visual experience.

- Improved Compatibility:
We've replaced actionbar feedback with chat-based messages. This change improves compatibility with other Minecraft Bedrock Add-Ons and ensures a smoother user experience.
