Afterward, you can set up cinematic camera paths to create stunning visuals of the replay. There are plenty of features available, which you can find in the §gKey Features§r menu.\n\n§6Note:-§r§b The cinematic menu/mechanic of ReplayCraft is stable, but the Replay menu/mechanic is new and not yet fully capable of recording everything.\n\nIt works best for recording while you're building, and its main purpose for now is to capture your building process in the background, which it does wonderfully.\n\nRest assured, I will continue improving it, and who knows - one day it might be powerful enough to record entire gameplay. For now, though, it excels when you're focused on building.§r\n\nThank you for downloading & using ReplayCraft!\n- §6DarkBlock Gaming\n\n\n");
