Here you will find the current chat commands for ReplayCraft and what they do.

# ReplayCraft Sticks
You can use the `?rc` command to obtain the control items to control ReplayCraft, simply using this will display the Graphical User Interface for ReplayCraft.

# Skins
You can use the `?skin` command to set your preferred custom skin and model size for the playback entity. This is in place so that all players can set their skin even when ReplayCraft is being controlled by another player.
