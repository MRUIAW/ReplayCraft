## Linear
This is the default easing type when using the cinematic camera mode. From each point the camera will progress at a constant speed during the time to reach point A to point B.

## InBack
The InBack easing gives the motion a dramatic, elastic-like "wind-up" effect before launching into the animation. It starts by going slightly backward, then moves forward with increasing speed.

## InBounce
With InBounce, the animation starts slowly, then quickly bounces toward the destination, with small decreasing jumps happening near the start.

## InCircle
Starts very slowly, then accelerates sharply toward the end. It follows the shape of a quarter circle, starting flat and curving steeply upward. This creates a smooth and natural acceleration, like how an object might move when turning in a circular arc.

</div>


## InCubic
Starts very slowly and then speeds up smoothly. This easing follows a cubic curve (t³), which makes the movement feel like it’s accelerating naturally — ideal for creating soft, gradual beginnings.

</div>

## InElastic
Starts slowly, then snaps forward with a bouncing, springy motion. It feels like a rubber band being pulled and released, creating a lively and dynamic movement.

</div>

## InExpo
Starts off very slowly and then speeds up exponentially toward the end, creating a sharp acceleration. It feels like something gaining momentum quickly after a slow start.

</div>

## InOutBack 
starts by going backward a bit, then moves forward past the target, and finally settles smoothly. It speeds up in the middle and slows down at the end, with a small “bounce” at both the start and finish.
