## Linear
This is the default easing type when using the cinematic camera mode. From each point the camera will progress at a constant speed during the time to reach point A to point B.

## InBack
The InBack easing gives the motion a dramatic, elastic-like "wind-up" effect before launching into the animation. It starts by going slightly backward, then moves forward with increasing speed.

</div>

## InBounce
With InBounce, the animation starts slowly, then quickly bounces toward the destination, with small decreasing jumps happening near the start.

</div>


## InCircle
Starts very slowly, then accelerates sharply toward the end. It follows the shape of a quarter circle, starting flat and curving steeply upward. This creates a smooth and natural acceleration, like how an object might move when turning in a circular arc.

</div>


## InCubic
Starts very slowly and then speeds up smoothly. This easing follows a cubic curve (t³), which makes the movement feel like it’s accelerating naturally — ideal for creating soft, gradual beginnings.

  <iframe src="charts/incubic.html" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>
</div>

## InElastic
Starts slowly, then snaps forward with a bouncing, springy motion. It feels like a rubber band being pulled and released, creating a lively and dynamic movement.

</div>

## InExpo
Starts off very slowly and then speeds up exponentially toward the end, creating a sharp acceleration. It feels like something gaining momentum quickly after a slow start.

</div>

## InOutBack 
starts by going backward a bit, then moves forward past the target, and finally settles smoothly. It speeds up in the middle and slows down at the end, with a small “bounce” at both the start and finish.

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px; border: none;">
  <iframe src="charts/inoutback.html" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>
</div>

## InOutBounce 
starts by bouncing upward gently, quickly gaining momentum. It then mirrors that bounce in reverse on the second half — like dropping a ball that bounces down and then back up in reverse. It's great for effects that need a bouncy start and end.

</div>

## InOutCirc
Starts slowly, speeds up in the middle, then slows down again toward the end. It follows the shape of a full circle arc, giving the motion a smooth and natural “ease-in and ease-out” effect — like swinging forward and backward along a circular path.

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px; border: none;">
  <iframe src="charts/inoutcirc.html" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>
</div>

## InOutCubic
Starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, then slows down again at the end. It creates a smooth, symmetrical motion that's great for transitions where you want a gentle start and finish.

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px; border: none;">
  <iframe src="charts/inoutcubic.html" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>
</div>

## InOutElastic
Starts and ends with a springy bounce, accelerating and overshooting in both directions. It’s like stretching a rubber band and letting it go—it wobbles before settling.

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px; border: none;">
  <iframe src="charts/inoutelastic.html" style="width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe>
</div>

## InOutExpo
This easing function starts very slow, then accelerates rapidly around the middle, and finally slows down again toward the end. It’s useful when you want a dramatic, fast movement in the middle of an animation, but smooth transitions at the start and end.

<div style="width: 800px; height: 400px; border: none;">

</div>

Further Out based easing types to be added.

## OutBounce 
mimics the motion of a ball dropping and bouncing several times before settling. It starts fast and finishes with smaller, slower bounces, giving a playful and dynamic ending to an animation.
